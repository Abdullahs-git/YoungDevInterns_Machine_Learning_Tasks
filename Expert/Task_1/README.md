Description for Task_1 in Professional level.
# Task 1: Develop a Neural Network for Classification (Expert Level)

## Overview
This task implements an expert-level neural network for multi-class classification using TensorFlow. The model is trained on the Wine dataset and includes:
- Normalization
- Dropout regularization
- Batch normalization
- Learning rate scheduling
- Early stopping

## Steps
1. Load and preprocess dataset using StandardScaler.
2. Build a deep neural network with multiple hidden layers.
3. Train using Adam optimizer with a decaying learning rate.
4. Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Display confusion matrix for detailed class-level evaluation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow >= 2.11
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
