# Task 1: Build a Model with Cross-Validation

## Overview
This task demonstrates how to evaluate a machine learning model using **k-fold cross-validation** in scikit-learn. The model’s performance is compared across folds using **accuracy** and **F1-score** metrics.

## Steps
1. Load the Iris dataset.
2. Initialize a RandomForestClassifier.
3. Apply 5-fold cross-validation.
4. Compute accuracy and F1-score for each fold.
5. Display mean performance metrics.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- numpy
