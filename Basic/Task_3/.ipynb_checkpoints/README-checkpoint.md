# Task 3 – Correlation Analysis and Visualization

## Objective
The objective of this task is to analyze and visualize the correlation between two numerical features using scatter plots and regression lines.  
This task demonstrates how relationships between variables can be positive, negative, or have no correlation, and how these relationships can be represented visually using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Task Description
In this task, three synthetic datasets are generated to illustrate different types of correlations:
- Positive Correlation: As one feature increases, the other also increases.
- Negative Correlation: As one feature increases, the other decreases.
- No Correlation: No clear relationship exists between the two features.

The script performs both numerical correlation analysis (using Pearson’s correlation coefficient) and visual analysis through scatter plots.

## Concepts Covered
- Understanding correlation and its significance  
- Calculating Pearson’s correlation coefficient  
- Visualizing relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Creating and interpreting scatter plots and regression lines

## Tools and Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy – for generating synthetic data  
- Pandas – for data handling and correlation calculation  
- Matplotlib – for basic visualizations  
- Seaborn – for enhanced plots and regression line fitting

## Steps Implemented
1. Generate Synthetic Data  
   Created three datasets demonstrating positive, negative, and no correlation using NumPy.
2. Compute Correlation Coefficients  
   Calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient using the Pandas `.corr()` method.
3. Visualize Relationships  
   Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot scatter plots with regression lines for each dataset.
4. Interpret Results  
   Compared the visual patterns and correlation values to understand the relationships.

## Conclusion
This task demonstrates how correlation can be both numerically and visually analyzed.  
By combining statistical measures with visualization, it becomes easier to identify the strength and direction of relationships between variables.  
This serves as a fundamental step in exploratory data analysis for machine learning workflows.
