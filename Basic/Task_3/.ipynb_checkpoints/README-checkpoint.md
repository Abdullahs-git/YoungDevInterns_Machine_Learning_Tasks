# Task 3 – Plot the Regression Line and Make Predictions

##  Objective
The goal of this task is to build and visualize a **Linear Regression model** using a synthetic dataset, evaluate its performance, and make predictions for new data points.

---

##  Task Description
- Generate a dataset that follows a roughly linear trend but includes random noise.  
- Train a **Linear Regression model** using `scikit-learn`.  
- Plot both the **data points** and the **regression line** to visualize model performance.  
- Evaluate the model using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score**.  
- Make predictions for new unseen values and analyze the results.

---

##  Concepts Covered
- Linear Regression Fundamentals  
- Model Training and Evaluation  
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib)  
- Model Prediction and Performance Metrics

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3.x**  
- **NumPy** – for numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib** – for data visualization  
- **scikit-learn** – for Linear Regression and metrics

---

##  Steps Implemented
1. **Import Libraries** – Load NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn modules.  
2. **Create Dataset** – Generate synthetic data with noise.  
3. **Train Model** – Fit a `LinearRegression()` model.  
4. **Evaluate Model** – Compute MSE and R² scores.  
5. **Visualize Results** – Plot regression line and actual data points.  
6. **Make Predictions** – Predict outcomes for new values.

---

##  Expected Output
- A plotted regression line fitting the noisy dataset.  
- Printed model parameters: **intercept** and **slope**.  
- Evaluation metrics: **Mean Squared Error** and **R² Score**.  
- Predicted results for new `X` values displayed in the console.

---
##  Conclusion
This task demonstrates how Linear Regression can effectively model linear relationships between variables. By plotting and predicting, we visualize how well the model generalizes, laying the foundation for more advanced regression techniques.
